"collide_2017","'Despite the hammy charades from both Kingsley and Hopkins, 'Collide' has to contend with poor camera work, cheap-looking action scenes and bland characters'DVD Movie Review: CollideDate Viewed: June 8 2017Directed By Eran Creevy (Welcome to the Punch)Screenplay By F. Scott Frazier and Eran Creevy, Story By F. Scott FrazierStarring: Nicholas Hoult, Felicity Jones, Ben Kingsley, Anthony Hopkins, Marwan Kenzari, Clemens Schick, Erdal Yildiz, Michael Epp, Aleksandar Jovanovic and Markus Klauk.No multi-car pile up on the highway could possibly explain the absurdity of 'Collide'. It's an action-thriller that has two bland performances and two highly over-the-top performances. It's supposed to be an action movie about an American living in Germany who has to save the love of his life by doing one last job for his drug kingpin boss but 'Collide' seems more interested in car-crashing than telling a lively story.Nicholas Hoult stars as Casey Stein, an American who's now living in Germany so that he can evade from the law back home. Casey did some bad things at home and now he's trying to start a new life in Germany. After telling his employer and drug smuggler, Geran (Ben Kingsley) he wants out, Casey starts to take control of his life until he meets another American at a nightclub. Her name is Juliette Marne (Felicity Jones) and they immediately fall for each other. Suddenly, Juliette faints to the ground and when she and Casey arrive at the hospital, the doctors inform Juliette that one of her kidneys has failed.Juliette needs a transplant immediately but she's not qualified to get one because she's not a citizen of Germany. This sad and terrible situation leaves Casey with no choice. He must return to his employer and ask for a job in order to secure the $250,000 he needs to go back to America and get Juliette the transplant she needs despite the fact that Casey is still a wanted man.Geran wants Casey to steal a precious cargo of cocaine-filled golf balls from another big drug kingpin but this one is more ruthless than him. This drug dealer and mob boss happens to be Hagen Kahl (Anthony Hopkins), Geran wanted to be partners with Hagen but he turned him down which left Geran angry and furious and now he seeks payback time. When the heist goes terribly wrong, Casey gets kidnapped by Hagen but he miraculously escapes and the movie turns into a low-rent 'Fast & Furious' rip-off. Casey's actions get repeated over and over again throughout, Casey steals a car, Casey crashes the car, Casey miraculously escapes from either Hagen's henchmen or the German authorities, he steals another car, he crashes another car, he miraculously escapes from the bad guys, he steals another car and yeah, you get the idea. Casey's dumb actions seem to the formula for this movie and it's annoying as F$&@!While he crashed Hagen's car, Casey manages to find $5 million in the automobile and he takes all of it and Hagen not only plans on getting the money back, he also desires in finding Casey's girlfriend. Fearing for Juliette's safety, Casey calls Geran to protect her from Hagen and his thugs before they can get to her. Nicholas Hoult is really bad here as Casey because he just makes one dumb decision after another and Felicity Jones is totally miscast as Casey's girlfriend who desperately needs a kidney transplant.As for Kingsley and Hopkins, their performances reach tremendous levels of awkward and hilarity. Kingsley's character not only has a bad Turkish accent, he really loves the 1985 John Travolta/Jamie Lee Curtis film 'Perfect' which was deemed so horribly bad by many film critics and he even thinks that Travolta should've won an Oscar for it and he also has a strange obsession for Burt Reynolds. Oh wait! there's more, Hopkins even does an impression of Sylvester Stallone. It's hard to fathom or believe that a knighted Oscar-winner would do an impression of him. I'll admit that it is fascinating to watch and I had a good laugh but this is the kind of zany impressions Hopkins can do on 'The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon'.The screenplay by director Eran Creevy (Welcome to the Punch) and F. Scott Frazier (XXX: Return of Xander Cage) is filled with plot holes, not so colorful dialogue and the action is just an exhausting cycle of wham and bam. Despite the hammy charades from both Kingsley and Hopkins, 'Collide' has to contend with poor camera work, cheap-looking action scenes and bland characters.","10","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","Collide dialogue is really cliche and tests my patience at times, but the action does keep you entertained. I would recommend this film more as a rental then something you go see at a theater.","20","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","Very good intense thrilling and spectacular movie.","30","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","Collide is deceptively good. Everything about it screams 'stay away' and 'generic.' And to an extent it is generic. None of its pieces yield any sort of base creativity, but all put together in just the right mixture the movie far and away exceeds expectations with a perfectly balanced assault of characterization, car chases, gun play, and intensity. It's never hyper real, and it's never gritty real. It's just a good, adrenaline-fueled movie that won't go down in the history books but that really nails that sweet spot for charged, contemporary action.","35","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","This was a great action movie ever! I loved this movie a lot because it's action sequences are great and the whole movie is phenomenal! It's a must see! You don't want to miss one of the greatest action movies of all time!","50","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"

"collide_2017","Quick money always ends in a big trouble!It's one of those films with aimless narration. Indeed, it has a nice cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.The two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this existing one which is very familiar with this language.People would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this one.6/10","30","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","Big cast little interest, 15 mins binned","05","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","Collide is a by-the-book action thriller with the typical car chases, gunfire, and stolen cash. Nicholas Hault is the lesser of two great actors in this film starring alongside Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins, perhaps that one reason why his acting felt too cheesy at times.","20","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","l am not their heavily me it just hard l can stop this, there are few cast and l don't get it, then simply help him find the money then get in cars recusced girlfriend who just kidnapped from medical hositpal after he love her what getting back.","20","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","A girl (Felicity Jones) needs a new kidney, his guy (Nicholas Hoult) is ready to do anything to get the money needed. So he gets back to his old criminal life, getting stuck between feuding gangsters (Anthony Hopkins, Ben Kingsley).'Collide' is functional, fast-paced and sometimes fun, if ultimately uninvolving actioneer. I have mostly positive things to say about it althought the result is not good enough to earn a recommendation.There will be a lot of shooting, punching and fast cars to satisfy the genre fan who just wants to see something new. The movie also has legendary actors Kingsley and Hopkins together on screen for the first time. And the young stars will not disappoint.But the screenplay is so sloppy that it's hard to stay invested. Firstly I didn't quite buy the main story arc of young petty thief outmaneuvering two veteran criminals with small armies, especially because it was done the cheapest way possible (sudden twists whenever convenient for storytellers). I also didn't buy the young hero as a guy never making mistakes or even getting hit hard, although he was constantly hunted by men who work as killers, and have a lot of shooting experience.Also, the story sits uncomfortably between two chairs, being neither serious enough nor tongue-in-cheek enough. You can't take it as a top-shelf actioneer, and it's not quite a flamboyant eurotrash either (many of the Jason Statham movies).As result, some of the stuff works (the beginning, action scenes), some not. Story becomes progressively more stupid, and Hopkins and Kingsley playing 'colorful' gangsters is like a ham-fisted parody of their roles in earlier, better movies.At least young stars are doing good work. Jones is cute enough to justify all this punching and shooting, and it's always good to see Hoult ('About a Boy', the newest 'Mad Max', Hank / Beast in 'X-Men') in a role which doesn't serve as just a window dressing.If he got a movie role as big and colorful as in the first season of TV series 'Skins', he could be the next Hollywood hero. He looks good in action too.","25","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","'Collide' is a knock-off 'Fast and the Furious' film about a hustler trying to make a better life for his ailing girlfriend (Felicity Jones). When a deal goes bad between two German drug lords (Ben Kingsley, Anthony Hopkins), Kingsley consigns the guy to steal a shipment of cocaibe from Hopkins. What ensues is a cheesy, third rate damsel in distress tale with cars that we've seen a million times before. The characters are static, and the action is whirlwind and confusing. This fim is also lookist and despite having entertainment value is a knock off rip off of better kidnap plots involving drugs and cars ------------------------------------ C","20","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","It was good but could have been better the car chases were good and the little action that was in it was not bad either. Safe to say you don't have to see right away but it's a good home movie to watch.","30","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"
"collide_2017","Dreadful dialogue, and the love story between the two leads just purely lack any chemistry. Get the DVD though, the action scenes are actually good when they happen.","20","Mystery & Suspense, Action & Adventure"

"the_lego_batman_movie","This movie had two scenes that were completely epic to watch: the clothes changing montage, and the 1960's back flash montage. The rest of the movie kind of lost me.

"the_lego_batman_movie","For a non-batman fan, I do love this movie. It was like base on a 90's kid playing lego batman that made into a movie. It has the humor same with the lego movie, I'm not quite sure if this movie is relatable to kids, it has a lot of adult humor onto it. As a full grown adult, it was such a hit to me.

"the_lego_batman_movie","This lego movie starts off with great satire but it slowly loses the way towards a family togetherness finale. The lego movie series is 2 for 2 and with another film due later this year, you would think the odds on their side. I liked the film and the humour, the voice work is incredible but a lot of those are lost in the midst of so many. If you're a Batman film you enjoy the interesting nods to 75 years of Batman history and some of those characters are laughably bad. Kids will enjoy the comedy but it is not just made for kids, the film will appeal to adults as well. I hope they continue with the spinoffs and there are so many they can do without direct sequels. The lego movie was extremely clever and this film is right up there but fails to stick the final third. 10-06-2017.","40","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"the_lego_batman_movie","This Batman movie works as an homage to all the Batman villains and also allies throughout its existence. It has a creative plot, reaching out to other villains from other universes such as Harry Potter, The Matrix, King Kong and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It has a lot of funny references and it is enjoyable to watch.","45","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"the_lego_batman_movie","As the second edition in the Lego Movie franchise, it's just as memorable or more so than the first Lego Movie. The theme is fantastic and it was super funny. I would recommend this to anyone all ages.","50","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"the_lego_batman_movie","Meh. I'd skip it. You'd think they could have done a much better job with the most interesting character from the Lego movie. The joke wears really thin in the first 5 minutes though, and then it's a sappy and poorly written movie.","20","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"the_lego_batman_movie","(R.I.P Adam West) The squeal to the modern hit 'The LEGO Movie'. The movie follows Batman (Will Arnett) adopting a young orphan named Dick Grayson (Micheal Cera). In which we see batman saving Gotham from villains, and learning about teamwork, family, and friends. The animation well done like the original, as well as the morals are told. However, it trys to much on pop culture refrences (which aren't all bad) with batman being plain meh. First of all, the animation is like the original not to fast, not to slow, not to hyper-realistic, but just right. The animation is wonky at times but, its passable. The star Batman trys so hard to be a mean guy, that it makes him ehhhh okay. Thanks to Will Arnett, it holds up to remind of the less mean batman from 'The LEGO Movie'. The lessons told in the movie will leave you feeling great as they are well told in the story. It shows the bounding of Batman and Dick being a good family, it can get weird at times, just ignore those parts. Finally, the large amount of pop culture references is scattered from Alfred's speech, to the big creatures in the final act of the film. Its wild, its fun, its nostalgic in many ways want a movie with pop culture from Warner Brothers? Overall, if Batman Had more personality, and if the movie had less pop culture references it would be better. The plus is the animation, morals, and the leads performance. 3 1/2 stars 72%","35","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Comedy"

"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","This movie would have been great if they didn't cast Emma Watson as Belle.

"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","Not spectacular, but still genuinely enjoyable. Some of the sets, directing, and cinematography weren't all that satisfying, but I still had a pretty decent time watching this. There wasn't really much that made this as memorable as the animated original. Each of the character portrayers had there decent moments, some different yet neat character restorations and story add-ons, as well as slight changes to the overall story as well.

"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","Excellent live action remake to an animated Disney classic! Bought the movie on BluRay recently after seeing it in the theater a couple months ago. Pitch perfect casting of all the characters overall. Especially liked the performances of Emma Watson as Belle, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, and Luke Evans as Gaston. Each brought their animated counterpart characters to life as well as could be imagined. Each member of the ensemble cast brought some realness and distinct personality to their characters in this live-action version. From the charm, fearlessness, independence, and radiance that Emma Watson represented and embodied into Belle. To the enthusiasm and pure fun that Ewan McGregor embraced with Lumiere. From the brashness and over-the-top entertaining persona Luke Evans brought to Gaston. The casting, acting performances, along with the CGI special effects, and the direction together combined to make this movie a magnificent success. For all the comments about auto-tuning the vocals of Emma Watson, it likely did happen. But they likely also did some level of auto-tuning for the other cast members vocals as well. But it honestly did not bother me. Some level of vocal enhancement, audio processing, and fine auto-tuning of recorded singing likely happens for movie musicals and audio recording studios for various performers. Not just for actors/actresses in movie musicals, but for studio music albums released for even the best musical artists. So some level of vocal sound production was likely done for the singing moments during this movie musical for the cast members to varying extents. In the end, this live action version 'Beauty & The Beast' will finish as one of the Top 10 grossing movies all-time revenue grosses earned at the box office. Both domestically and internationally worldwide overall. So based on those box office results, a vast majority people who saw this movie enjoyed, were entertained, and pleased with what they saw in the theaters. Amazing accomplishment to all involved in the movie for giving us an entertaining live action version of an animated classic that will be remembered for generations to come. Superb job!","50","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","To be honest, this movie disappointed me, in terms of overdoing things. I mean this movie was great, but it was a bit exaggerating","25","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","Only managed to watch about 10 minutes of this... and with much effort. It seems more like a Hollywood attempt at a bad Bollywood movie than the original classic. None of the human characters are likeable. The Plot: Belle is sick of her 'provincial' (read 'poor') life [she sings a whole song about it] but, then meets a super wealthy beast (read super wealthy ugly mo-fo) who takes her to Paris and wines and dines her in his massive castle - he also gives her a sizeable library without flinching. This leads her to fall in love with him (read his money) and that breaks the spell and he becomes good looking (in reality plastic surgery). All young girls should strive to find a rich man no matter how ugly he is","05","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","Superb movie. Very entertaining live-action remake of a Disney animated classic. Saw it in the theater opening weekend back in mid-March and just bought the movie on BluRay disc this week. The casting was 1st rate overall. Starting with Emma Watson, who portrayed Belle with modern enlightenment, radiance, and fearless strength. While at the same time, instilling a sense of charm and touch of sweetness that gives the main character Belle a completeness and realism that forms the core of the movie. She embodied and naturally grew into the role of Belle as the movie developed and brought the animated character to life as well as could be imagined and portrayed in this live action remake. Other standout performers include Dan Stevens as the Beast/Prince. Luke Evans as Gaston, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, and Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts. The overall casting selections was the primary strength of this Disney movie musical remake.As far as the comments about auto-tuning vocals, this movie musical likely had it's fair share of vocal optimization and audio processing of the singing scenes during production release. Every musical production and studio recording album goes through that process. Why is that? Because even the best singers and musical artists generally sound better on their released studio recording albums compared to live event concert singing, so it is the nature of the process. I think Emma Watson and the rest of the cast each gave admirable vocal performances during their singing moments. Other than Luke Evans and Ewan McGregor, I don't think any of the actors portraying the other main characters had previous Broadway stage theater play experience. If this was casting for the Broadway musical version, then better singers and stage performers would have clearly been cast. But given this was casting for a movie/musical remake, so the combination acting talents and singing abilities of the actors and actresses were well-chosen and more than fit the bill to provide a top-notch movie/musical production.This live action remake version of 'Beauty & The Beast' has become an all-time Top 10 movie at the US domestic ($500+ million) and international worldwide ($1.25+ billion) in box office revenues. As both a success with critics and this behemoth box office performance with audience worldwide, the results and reactions speak for itself. Well done, great work, and amazing accomplishment by Walt Disney studios, director Bill Condon, and by the great acting ensemble cast. Looking forward to more live action remakes. Sensational achievement in movie making by everyone involved!","50","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","One cannot help but to compare this 'Beauty And The Beast' with the Disney cartoon, given that it hews so closely to the original cartoon version. At times in the beginning, the films seemed shot-for-shot duplicates. In that light, the live-action music, characters and singing just aren't as 'big' as those in the animated film. However, making such a comparison, is not fair to this live-action version, which itself is very fine. The sets and costumes are spectacular. The CGI is (mostly) impressive. (Just avoid looking at the Beast's face throughout the film and you'll think it was faultless.) The music is marvelous on its own, even if most of the new numbers are lackluster. This version is a definite five-star film on its own, which would be clearly evident it it didn't have to measure up to its predecessor.","50","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","Really cool movie. Follows the plot of the disney animated film with a few added details. If you liked the animated film, you are sure to like this one!","40","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","This movie was not what I expected at any level but overall it was a pleasant, enjoyable experience. A bit to my surprise I found myself enjoying the musical scenes of the movie the most. The singing, dancing and visuals were spot on in nearly all of them. The visuals overall in the movie I thought were great, the movie certainly had style. The animated characters were a strong suit rather than a weak point. The acting was good, which would be expected with this cast. But there was enough missing that it wasn't great. I think it had to do with synthesis, how it all came together. Perhaps it was drawn out a bit much with not enough material. The crucial tail end of the relationship felt a bit contrived and did not work well. I also did not like the whole concept of the enchantress playing a wicked god who tortures a whole village over nothing important, but perhaps not much can be done about the source material which is a fairy tale. If you like a visually stunning movie with realistic looking animations of everyday objects, a delightfully entertaining musical, solid acting by a stellar cast between musical scenes, and a solid plot that gives its cast some material to work with, clean-cut family fun, and immersion into a medieval fantasy period piece, then I strongly recommend this movie.","35","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
"beauty_and_the_beast_2017","There was never that SPARK like in the cartoon. Emma Watson could have shown more emotion. I didn't feel the nurturing or love between belle and the beast.

"a_cure_for_wellness","Everything about the movie is GREAT except Dale Dehaan's acting. Don't get me wrong, he is good, just not great. This is sad, because I really like Dehaan. The ending is sort of lame.","30","Mystery & Suspense"
"a_cure_for_wellness","The incredible design and camera work is not enough to overcome a simplistic plot. I will compare this to Tim Burton who has demonstrated a gift for the odd but at the expense of the storyline. I liked certain parts of the film but it felt too commercial to be successful, the budget needed to be lower and the weirdness dialled up to 11. The film flopped and it's fairly obvious why a mid budget film would flop when it is this bizarre. The film needed to be in the 20 million, I can't see where the budget went and that is the problem. In an era where Blumhouse is punching out quality films below 10 million, you need to aim for a similar bar. The director had a great eye for Pirates and The Ring but he hasn't set the world on fire and I feel he needs to reinvent the wheel, no point coasting and that's how I felt for most of the movie. There was a waiting and when it was finally revealed, you just shrug and wonder why you just watched a movie past 2 hours without any redeeming twists or set pieces. This was a giant miss and while it's not terrible, it is no where near being good. 13-06-2017.","20","Mystery & Suspense"
"a_cure_for_wellness","I rarely hate a movie so deeply. To explain myself, i'll say that i was extremely excited to see this movie: the trailer hiked my expectations to the sky. A cure for wellness showed potential for a stylistic masterpiece, and flopped as the horribly acted, horribly scripted wannabe-story mess it is. Firstly, the set design, the soundtrack, the visual experience in general was everything i wanted it to be. Eerie, hauntingly beautiful, sinister, and captivating. But everything else truly disappointed that stylistic potential. Dehaan is TERRIBLE in the role. Giving a joke of a performance as the almost comically static lead. The singular emotion he can show is that furrowed-brow aggravation. In scenes where i feel tension, places where any well acted human would show fear--Dehaan misses all those marks. I hate so much about this movie. A Cure for Wellness feels the need to intentionally hand-hold moviegoers as if they cannot develop thoughts on their own, forcefully mouth-feeding all of the plot to viewers in a painful, obvious script. Overall, A Cure for Wellness is haughty, crossing well over the 'ambitious' line and diving head first into excessive and unnecessary. It opts to gross viewers out through rape, period pools, eel waterboarding, random jerk-off scenes for an easy 'ew,' rather than any real suspense or mystery, which the story completely lacks. The superfluous allegories scattered across the film: the cliche deer symbolism, 'The ballerina is Hanna! Look, they are both dancing! See it? Can you see it? Do you get it?' and all those random, jumbled cut-scenes of eels. Never adding any real meaning to the plot, and far more likely confusing viewers than establishing any sort of atmospheric suspense. Directed as if viewers would somehow easily be fooled into seeing a deeper meaning in all that irrelevant symbolism and hiding behind (deceivingly) stunning visuals, A Cure for Wellness wants to be more sophisticated than what it really is: horrible.","10","Mystery & Suspense"
"a_cure_for_wellness","I really enjoyed this movie. It was a really wel acted non linear storyline. As opposed to the generic vague ending trend that has plagued modern cinema, this film has a definitive ending, although this leaves several loose strings completely unanswered. I had almost as much fun trying to connect the dots after the film as I did watching it. The director has created a hell of an amosphere with its European village setting and usage of a drab color pallets. A lot of haunting imagery is used and I found this film to be one that would stick with me for a while. Fans of movies such as Session 9 and Shutter Island should really enjoy this film","40","Mystery & Suspense"
"a_cure_for_wellness","'There's a germ of a worthy idea somewhere in it's sick little mind and it has a unique production design but 'A Cure for Wellness' is just dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, DULL!'DVD Movie Review: A Cure for WellnessDate Viewed: June 6 2017Directed By Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Mouse Hunt, Rango, The Lone Ranger and The Ring)Screenplay By Justin Haythe, Story By Justin Haythe and Gore VerbinskiStarring: Dane DeHaan, Jason Issacs, Mia Goth, Adrian Schiller, Celia Imrie, Ashok Mandanna, Harry Groener, Godehard Giese, Tomas Norström, Magnus Krepper, Carl Lumbly and Lisa Banes.'A Cure for Wellness' should've found a cure for dullness because this gothic horror thriller is a boring mess and it's two and a half hours long. Sure, the trailer for this film became infamous for showing a woman in a bathtub full of eels and it has some disturbing images but this movie is far from scary. There's a germ of a worthy idea somewhere in it's sick little mind and it has a unique production design but 'A Cure for Wellness' is just dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, dull, DULL!The plot revolves around a young American executive named Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) whose company is the target of an ongoing criminal investigation and the company's board members want him to retrieve the company's CEO Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener) from a mysterious 'wellness center' in the Swiss Alps and bring him back to America so that the board members can pin the investigation on him.When Lockhart arrives at his destination, he slams into a deer and gets into a horrible car accident. When he wakes up, Lockhart finds himself in the mysterious 'wellness center' where he encounters Dr. Heinrich Volmer (Jason Issacs). He's the person in charge of this remote spa and resort and on top of that all of his guests and patients have strange diseases and all of them stay there in the hope of finding a cure for their illness. When Lockhart finds Pembroke, he discovers that he's not himself. Even with a broken leg, Lockhart tries to figure out the history of this 'wellness center' and he even finds the time to hang out with a mysterious girl named Hannah (Mia Goth). When Lockhart finds that there is something off about this so-called 'wellness center', he tries to make a run for it and contacts the authorities but what do you know even the police are on Dr. Heinreich Volmer's payroll. This mad doctor is just as consistent as Hillary Clinton. We also find out that the spa and resort is actually an Arkham Asylum for twisted medical experiments and Dr. Volmer plans on using Hannah for some kind of satanic ritual but I didn't care much at all because this movie is frickin boring.'A Cure for Wellness' was directed by Gore Verbinski who did 'Rango', the first three 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films, 'The Ring', 'Mouse Hunt' and the 2013 big-budget disaster known as 'The Lone Ranger'. Verbinski has taken an off-the-wall premise and he splashes it right in front of us but 'A Cure for Wellness' has major problems, the psychological parts of the film seem unfocused, the horror aspects are nowhere to found, the characters are not really interesting, the script by Verbinski and Justin Haythe (The Clearing, Revolutionary Road, Snitch and The Lone Ranger) makes no sense and yeah just like with Verbinski's three 'Pirates' films and 'The Lone Ranger', the movie doesn't want to end. 'A Cure for Wellness' is a horror film that seems more interested in exposition than wanting to scare the '$&@!' out of you.","15","Mystery & Suspense"

"a_cure_for_wellness","(Spoilers ahead) I had such high hopes for this flick and was terribly disappointed. It had such so much potential but in the end the story line just didn't deliver. The creep factor was there but ultimately it boiled down to some pedophile trying to bone his daughter by keeping them alive for centuries. They never explain how the eels help keep them alive. In addition the ending was weird. The protagonist had an evil smile at the very end which leaves the viewer hanging. You don't know if the eels he ingested are somehow turning him into the antagonist or what. 2.5 hours later and it will leave you unfulfilled.","20","Mystery & Suspense"
"a_cure_for_wellness","The visuals are stunning, but the movie is too long and messy in terms of ideas or whatever it wants to say, to the point that it doesn't make any sense and seems more like an amalgam of a lot of things that worked infinitely better in other movies (like Shutter Island).","20","Mystery & Suspense"
"a_cure_for_wellness","Shutter Island meets Hammer Horror. Feels very long, and has a few questionable moments, but I can't get enough of this movie. Not quite bad enough to be 'so bad, it's good', but it veers in that direction, especially towards the end.","35","Mystery & Suspense"
"growing_up_smith","Great script, great cast! Go watch it!","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Terrific culture-clash movie in the vein of Fresh Off The Boat and other comedies told from the perspective of growing up as a first generation American. The art direction is terrific and the story is going to touch everyone as you root for Smith. Director, Frank Lotito has put together a perfect film with excellent acting all around especially from newcomer, Roni Akurati. Would be great to see this one become a series in the future.","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Growing up Smith is a wonderful movie. It tells the story of an Indian immigrant family who comes to this country and the challenges they face in bringing up their children in a different world and different culture. Their story, is the story of everyone who's come to this country. It could be from anywhere in the world, and all of them have the same concern. They want their children to grow up with their values, and they want to treat them and have them brought up the way they were. They want to expose them to the same things they were exposed to, and to reach success in life while not losing their culture. But, they want them to grow up in this country, a different environment, one that can give them a real chance at success.The movie takes us through the experiences of the mother, father, their daughter and their little boy. You see how they interact with an American family who lives next door. You will enjoy the performances from the actors, especially the young actor who plays the little boy. He is an amazing talent to watch. He is literally a natural, from the way he talks, his expressions and the way you feel his emotions. Ultimately, every parent will have to decide for their children and their family what is best to do. Are they sure it is the best? You never know. Some people decide to go ahead and let their children live and grow up where they are born. It is a country different than where they are now. Different values, a different way of life. Others will raise their children in another world, but do their best to make sure they don't forget their culture.Through watching this movie, it will touch your heart. It is a wonderful story, a wonderful portrayal of what every immigrant family goes through. For me as an immigrant, I lived this. Even though I chose a different path for my children. You make a decision and hope for the best. You hope they learn from you as a parent with the way you raise them and the values you instill in them from when you grew up. As the end, it is a very funny movie. You are going to laugh a lot, you will cry, it is a beautiful story, written very well and something I really enjoyed. Go ahead and give it a chance, it's a great movie.","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","This movie was so funny and sweet. I laughed and cried. I think anyone with a sense of humor or heart will love this movie.","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Now this film I just saw and had to say something! THESE are the kinds of films we've been missing all these years. Growing up Smith is the perfect combination of a family-kid friendly film with some teeth to it. Lighthearted with a message, funny, exuberant and most timely in today's America.This film won't preach to you and I can't put my finger on just one thing in particular, but it left me feeling euphoric walking out. Nostalgia, memories and emotions flowed through me. It hearkens back to a time where we were all innocent. As kids emulating our parents and yearning to break out.The performances are just as impressive. Jason Lee appears in a role I've never seen him play, and plays it to perfection: The beer drinking role model... Hilarie Burton and Poorna Jagannathan play characters who couldn't be more opposite, yet are equally as endearing. Anjul Nigam was terrific and relentless. At times I felt as though he was the film's hero and others it's villain. Lastly, the kids stole the show. Brighton Sharbino and Roni Akurati were delightful. They had tremendous rapport with one another and delivered as authentic performances as I have seen kids deliver in a film!If you want to have fun, if you want to laugh, if you want tears in your eyes and if you want to remember the good old days, THIS is the film to see! Very impressed, Bravo!","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Awful movie. Terrible acting, save for Lee, and not funny at all. Need to get your inner critic in you checked if you liked this thing.","05","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Are you fed up or angered at current events around the world today? Do the pressures at work or daily life have you consumed? This film is your remedy! From the first minute to the last, you find yourself embracing the innocence of being young again in simpler times. The thought and detail that went into this production were quiet and subtle, but bold enough that you felt as if you were sitting in your own '70s/'80s house. I found myself saying 'hey,I had that bike!' or 'my mom drove that car.' The actors and actresses were true to life. It is hard believe this was 'Smith's' debut. He was genuine! You will catch yourself smiling through this whole film. Growing up Smith is a must see for everyone!","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Growing Up Smith is a charming, sweet coming-of-age story that has more going on than at first glance. Anyone who remembers falling in love for the first time will relate to the awkward young Smith who has a huge crush on the girl across the street. Yet Smith's future has been mapped out by his traditional Indian father: a young bride has already been selected for him, and he's expected to become a neurosurgeon. Issues about balancing tradition with assimilation force the family to make difficult decisions. Young Smith also has to contend with school bullies and racial/ethnic challenges. Despite this, Growing Up Smith never loses its heart and humor.I can't say enough about this movie. It is a gentle delight worth seeing again and again.","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Wonderful heartfelt film about love, friendship and what it means to be an immigrant in America in the late 1970s.","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"
"growing_up_smith","Full disclosure: I am a filmmaker myself, I watch films not only as entertainment, but always tend to evaluate and study each and every element that goes into making a hopefully successful film. Watching this film wasn't only entertaining, it was a monumental achievement. Growing up Smith is an engaging story about a boy who is an Indian immigrant growing up before our eyes, falling in love with his first crush, dealing with bullies and an ever-changing family dynamic... No this isn't the story of January 2017, it is actually set in 1979. However timely this film may be, it goes beyond the preferential force feeding you may come to expect from films that are socially or politically charged in today's climate... It hits you where it hurts most, your heart. You see, this film connected with me on numerous levels, not because I am Indian or an immigrant, I am neither. I am an American born in Virginia. It hit me hard because it tapped into the innocence we are all born with as children. That innocence that knows no skin tone, no material objects, no predisposition to one's background, only the natural, visceral feelings we have as kids.At the center of this story is Smith, played effortlessly by newcomer Roni Akurati, a young boy who deeply yearns to be an American. He wants to eat apple pie, listen to the Bee Gees and eat KFC. He also falls in love with his first crush, the figurative and literal girl next door, a young blonde, blue eyed girl, the enchanting and lovable Amy, played by Brighton Sharbino. As the two become friends, his desire to be American grows as he befriends her father Butch Brunner, played by Jason Lee. On the surface, I don't have to tell you much about Butch Brunner you can't already surmise from his name. Glad they stopped short of naming him Biff a la Back to the Future. What is different about Butch is that despite his exterior, he too is an endearing figure that we can all relate to. He is the hard working, beer drinking, meat loving, full bearded white guy from Oklahoma who like many Americans struggles to make ends meat, raise a family and find happiness in this world. The two form a bond, a friendship that transcends their age, their race or their position in life. There are many layers and subplots to this film which uncommonly do not detract from the main story-line. There is the overly-strict Indian father constantly battling the urge to have his family assimilate, but not lose their own identity and culture. His wife who tries to hold the family together. Butch's wife who has the impossible job of sticking by her husband and supporting his wishes and dreams like keeping his motorcycle, however balancing the looming monthly elephant in the room called mortgage, bills, life.This was as honest, entertaining, heartwarming and evocative a film as I have seen. That isn't hyperbole, it is simply the humble feelings of a filmmaker who recognizes 'okay, the bar's been set'. The subtlety, the sincerity from scene to scene and character to character made this not only an enjoyable film, but one I truly respected and will hold close. In closing, I must say that maybe equally as impressive as the film itself, is the fact that this is an Indie. This film was made for 2 million dollars which on its own is an outstanding achievement. The film being set in 1979, having star quality talent both on screen and off. I don't recall an Indie this well-crafted. Masterfully directed by Frank Lotito, beautifully shot by Thomas Scott Stanton, and what a terrific script by Paul Quinn, Gregory Scott Houghton and one of the film's stars Anjul Nigam. I could go on and on, the production design, music, all of the performances, all of these visual components contributed to make a timeless film that if you told me was a major Studio release-50 million dollar film, I wouldn't think twice. It is that complete. Not sure if this film is considered in this past year's flock of films (It is listed 2015, but releasing 2017) but if it is, it is certainly in my top 10 of best films of the year. Hat's off to all involved, you made a tremendous film.","50","Drama, Kids & Family, Comedy"

"3_generations","While it offers some good acting and great moments here and there, 3 Generations is nothing but a boring, tedious, muddled, and forgettable mess.","20","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","'3 Generations' could have, would have and should have been a great movie if the director Gaby Dellal and Nikole Beckwith, who co-write the screenplay with Dellal, didn't go off on a tangent instead of dealing with Elle Fanning's character Ray, who was born Ramona, and has many obstacles with his transition.His single mother Maggie, played by Naomi Watts, and Ray, live with her mother, Dodo, played by Susan Sarandon, and her longtime lover Frances, played by Linda Emond.At the beginning of the movie we see Maggie trying to deal with Ray's decision, struggling with what verbs to use, worried that after Ray goes through the change he may think he made a mistake plus having to put up with Dodo, an old time feminist, who believes Ray should stay Ramona and just be a lesbian. If the film had stuck with Ray's story and the reaction of the two older generation it would have been an excellent film but instead it veers off to Maggie's past and the complications that involvesRay's father Craig, played by Tate Donovan, who hasn't had anything to do with Ramona for more than a decade, now discovers his daughter needs his signature on the consent form to become his son. We also meet his brother Matthew, played by Sam Trammell, who was involved with them. Throw in that Craig now haves another family with 3 kids and all of a sudden we turn from an involved story of a transgender person into a soap opera.Maggie's story is interesting but she deserves her own movie. This movie is only an hour and 27 minutes but it feels as if 3 hours was being packed into it.Elle Fanning gives a very strong, believable performance as a transgender teenager who knows who he is and is willing to stand up for his decisions while Naomi Watts as his mother shows the perplexing problems a parent can go through while this is all taking place with an equally strong performance. As always Sarandon gives a dynamic performance while Linda Emond is very droll as the put upon lover. They are both wasted in the film as are Donovan and Trammell's story lines .Television is way ahead of film regarding the issues and understandings of transgender while movies, aside from 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'The Crying Game', need to get serious on the subject.'3 Generations' is a good start on transgender issues but it gets bogged down in what use to be called a 'women's film'. It is worth seeing for Fanning's performance and for people who have no idea what transgender people are about and go through.","30","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","I don't understand the negative reviews of this movie. I thought it was incredibly touching and well done. I recommend this movie to all generations! It brilliantly depicts how being transgender is not a choice, but how very important it is to have an accepting and loving support even though family members have their own struggles. The acting was incredible, especially Elle Fanning!","45","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","this movie is the same old comedy we have been getting recently, we get a topic that is shocking like transgender high school student and they people thing that everything would fall right into place, but they don't have a great script, story or anything to keep it floating, but the acting is nice especially Ella Fanning.","25","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","I really enjoyed the humour in this film, and the film as a whole was quite good. Elle Fanning blew me away with her performance. She really transformed into this character. I'd definitely recommend it; it's worth seeing for sure.","40","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","3 Generations wekt voornamelijk irritatie op als een compleet misplaatste kijk in het leven van een jonge transgender tiener die leert leven met der verandering. Zowel de drama als acteerprestaties komen vooral houterig over, waardoor dit gedoemd was om te falen vanaf dag 1.","15","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","I think most people are just too focused on the whole transgender teenager thing. The movie is much more than that. If you can treat this whole transgender thing like other major life choices than It is a pretty good drama about family and identity.","45","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","It was an alright movie. Being Trans myself I can somewhat relate but I feel like some parts could have been handled better. My favorite part was the doctor's line. It's available online but It hasn't official been in theaters yet. I'm just a bit upset they changed the title from About Ray to 3 Generations.","30","Drama, Comedy"
"3_generations","Despite a seriously unbalanced storyline, in that it isn't quite sure what story to tell; About Ray attempts to engage its audience with wonderfully strong lead performances, into the world of transgender identity.","40","Drama, Comedy"

"the_blackcoats_daughter","I'm gonna start talking about something that the movie isn't really about, though there's still some relation to this film and where it goes with its narrative. Demonic possession/exorcism movies are certainly a tricky bunch to pull off. By that I mean the fact that every single one of these movies lives under the very large shadow that was cast by The Exorcist when it first came out almost FORTY-FIVE years ago. And there's a good reason for that, The Exorcist is still the best film about demonic possession that I've ever seen. No movie, that I've seen, that has tackled the same subject even ever come close to achieving that same level. I've even seen movies that poked fun at The Exorcist while failing miserably at everything they set out to do. How does that relate to this movie? I don't really know, I mean there's an element here of demonic possession and there's one scene, a short scene, of an exorcism. But the movie isn't about just that. It's more about exploring the dynamics of Katherine's personality and what drove her to commit the horrible acts that she did. And, in all honesty, it's a legitimately messed up movie, because it's not afraid to go to places that other movies just don't go. There's a level of brutality and heartlessness seen in Katherine's actions that I haven't seen in a horror movie in, it seems, ages. I think that's what gives the film its strength, to me, the fact that they can showcase such acts without anything in the way of sugarcoating. They don't try to pretty it up, however you go about prettying up what Katherine did. If I'm being honest, parts of this really remind me of last year's excellent, but divisive, The Witch. I can't really say that both movies are conventional horror flicks, because they're not. The Witch is more psychological horror, while I'd say that this movie falls under that same description. It's a slow building, tension rich and atmospheric experience. If I'm gonna be honest, there's very little here in the way of character development. Very few details, but those details are indeed very important, are revealed about Rose, Katherine, Rose's family and Joan. There's this mystery surrounding Katherine's parents that is never resolved, though the implication is that they are, in fact, dead. How they die is never really told, but it's not really relevant. There's a scene, prior to Katherine losing her mind, that heavily implies that something happened to her parents. The headmaster, along with a cop, came back to school grounds. ***SPOILERS*** It is never explained what exactly was afflicting Katherine/Joan. Was it a case of extreme mental illness or a legitimate demonic possession? I don't believe there's such a thing as the latter, but I'm suspending my disbelief. Why did Katherine, having escaped the insane asylum she was kept in after 9 years, then go out and kill Rose's parents. These people, apparently, never knew that Kath was the one responsible or don't remember what she looked like as the father (Bill) decided to help Kath out by giving her a ride to where she's going as she reminded him of his daughter. Then there's the ending that, I'm sure, people are gonna debate. The way I see it, it's actually very a simple ending to follow. Remember when I said that there was an exorcism scene at the hospital, after Kath's initial rampage. Well there was another thing I forgot to mention, in a couple of scenes prior to the hospital one, you got to see a black horned figure when the story was being told from Kath's perspective. This, obviously, represents the 'evil' that was afflicting her and whatnot. During the exorcism scene, this figure is scene again as Kath asks it not to leave her. The exorcism is a 'success', as in the next shot of where the horned figure was standing, it is no longer there. Katherine, escaping after 9 years, went back to the place where her rampage initially began, a prep school, in hopes of actually finding this demon to possess her again. And I can go in deeper into the film's themes, but I'd be here forever, that's just my basic theory for what Katherine was trying to accomplish. She led a very lonely existence and the one thing she had was taken from her, so she was gonna do whatever it took to get that...thing back, even if that meant letting an 'evil spirit' take over her body again. It's kinda messed up, as I said, but that's what I like about the movie. And, really, there's very little that I don't actually like about this movie. I liked the tone, I love the atmosphere of dread and despair that it built, I love how dark it truly went. The acting is top-notch as well, Kiernan Shipka (who played teen Katherine) was absolutely tremendous here. I don't think I've ever seen her before, but she was quite the creepy actress here. And I do mean legitimately creepy. Emma Roberts is great as always, as is Lucy Boynton. I really don't think I have anything else to say here, I really liked this movie a lot. It starts out slow, and some people are gonna hate that, but this is a movie that certainly pays off on its concepts. It pays off those concepts in a visual and visceral fashion as opposed to it paying off on its narrative, but this is still a really compelling experience. One that I'm sure is gonna divide people, but it's still one that I would definitely highly recommend to film geeks in general.","35","Horror"
"the_blackcoats_daughter","About the two girls who stayed behind on their school break.Also known as 'February', is about two teen girls from closely, but a different timeline. It was the boarding school break and everyone heading their home, but a couple of girls stay behind as they have no other choice. While waiting for their parents to pick them up, those few days do not go well with them. What it is and how the story ends, you should watch it to learn.It is not a must see, or even it does not look fresh enough. Though very dark and there's a moment it peaks with its suspense. But it could not hold any further, or keep us expecting what might come. Both the tales that told parallely was distinguished at the end with a small twist. But not everything was fully explained. So you will be disappointed a bit on that ground on overall film.Those young actresses were really good. Roberts and Shipka who never meet given the best performances in their respective roles. An horror with a less traditional narration. Feels familiar, but not really as entirely. Because if you don't know what its genre, you could anticipate a regular drama-thriller, but they manipulated the genre very well that you won't fully able to unpuzzle, even after the end. Just one time watchable film, in a common sense, but there are people who like this kind of film better than usual horror films.5/10","25","Horror"
"the_blackcoats_daughter","This was a very intense film that is slow but builds to an ending that will leave you you breathless. This is very much like Perkins other film I seen on Netflix and while that was slow, it was also very atmospheric. The film is full of talented actors and the strength behind the scenes compliments them. The overall story is full of holes and we never learn too much, the final 30 mins left me puzzled. I like a thinking movie compared to the other hollywood horror films, this will sit with you long after the finale. Perkins is a talent to watch and while the masses will not like this, cinema addicts will eat this up. 14-05-2017.","35","Horror"

Set in Denmark at the end of the Second World War we follow young German prisoners of war that are ordered to remove landmines from the Danish coastline.

"land_of_mine","A story of perpetual struggle and emotional hardship, Land Of Mine, a refreshingly clever title pun, documents the exploits of an oft-forgotten group of German World War 2 soldiers. Forced to clear the mines their own countrymen had planted along the Danish coast, while also facing up to the prejudice of those who previous fought against them, the movie does a stellar job of not only getting us to sympathise with the prisoners of war, but also care for them. Many of the mine disarming scenes are close to nail-biting, and whenever one of them goes off it's a genuine shocker, especially in the excellent training phase sequence. The Danish superiors often come across as one-dimensional villains with no redeeming values, with Roland Møller's resentful Sergeant being the only one which gets any development or moments of genuine humanity, but it's the only significant weakness I believe the film possesses. It's hard to believe the depicted events were condoned, considering that the young soldiers forced to clear the mines were conscripted at the tail end of the war, and as such had little chance to participate in any important battles. But the film demonstrates how prejudice can often be the most blinding feeling we have, particularly in a time of conflict. Frank, hard-hitting and illuminating, Land Of Mine is a war film which will likely never get the credit or attention it deserves, but if anything, that's even more of a reason to watch it.","45","Art House & International, Drama"
"land_of_mine","Land of Mine: More than 2000 German POWs were forced to clear nearly two million landmines from the beaches of Denmark following WWII. Most were teenagers and most died or were horribly maimed in the process. This gut-wrenching, 2017 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film is the story about a group of them. It is a film of juxtaposition - virtual children performing adult tasks, shockingly grisly deaths on a beautiful beach, and one-time oppressors who now are the oppressed. While the harrowing story is emotionally akin to two nerve-racking hours of Russian roulette, it is so exquisitely done with such powerful performances and a haunting score that it should be seen by everyone... but probably only once.

"land_of_mine","The film is gripping and tense enough to compensate for the main character's problems in characterization - especially his abrupt change in behavior towards the German boys, which comes off as forced and heavy-handed -, and it also benefits from a strong ending.","35","Art House & International, Drama"
"land_of_mine","Knowing that the key elements in this film will consist of German teenager POWs being forced to clear landmines, the brutal consequences are inevitable and there can be no mystery about what awful scenes it must contain. Its point is simple: this is no way to treat children regardless of how Hitler's Germany used them, or what they did in the war. It depicts the vengeful Allies as little better than the enemy, when they are subjecting the boys to inhuman labour, starvation, beatings and humiliation. Bridging the two worlds is the boys' commandant, a Danish sergeant who carries out his orders, but with degrees of compassion. The film begs the questions: what is the right punishment for an oppressor and how far down into the population should it have extended; at what point is following orders a defence to war crimes; how were these boys recruited or conscripted; what would these boys have become, if Nazi Germany had prevailed; what do they symbolise now. And, if the method of clearing the mines was the forced labour of the enemy, in the form of half-starved, sick, scared and degraded teenagers, what guarantee is there even now that the beaches and the other minefields of Europe are safe? The film's ending, while appropriate to the story, leaves the questions open. The Danish sergeant's way is to understand the past, and then to lock it away, never to be repeated, but the unknown factor is how many agree with him - then, or now.","35","Art House & International, Drama"

"land_of_mine","Solid story, pretty different war film, or post war film. Exciting all the way, as you can expect when the plot basicly is land mine clearing in Denmark. It's done by German soliders. Young ones, probably war prisoners or something. They are not very popular fellas so people never care about their very dangerous work. They don't care if most of them die, they only want it done.Great location, lovely visuals and some nice editing. Very solid acting once again from Roland Møller. He's becoming one of my Danish favorites, really.It's a bit predictable, that kills a bit of the vibe, but not too much. In total it's a very solid historical drama. 'Krigen', another Danish war film done the same year was another very solid film.

"aftermath_2017","'Oh Arnold, this is what the 'Aftermath' looks like when you terminate your 'Celebrity Apprentice' hosting duties and bash Donald Trump by simply offering him to switch jobs'Movie Review: AftermathDate Viewed: June 8 2017Directed By Elliott Lester (Blitz and Nightingale)Written By Javier GullónStarring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Scoot McNairy, Maggie Grace, Judah Nelson, Martin Donovan, Hannah Ware, Mariana Klaveno, Kevin Zegers, Glenn Morshower, Larry Sullivan and Teri Clark Linden.Oh Arnold, this is what the 'Aftermath' looks like when you terminate your 'Celebrity Apprentice' hosting duties and bash Donald Trump by simply offering him to switch jobs. 'Aftermath' is a drama so broody and very bleak, it feels unfocused and out of place. Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying very hard to be a compelling actor with dramatic range but he fails miserably thanks to a very weak screenplay. The first act of the movie is well drawn but the rest of 'Aftermath' feels like it came from depressing therapy sessions.Inspired by actual events, Arnold plays Roman Melnik, a construction foreman who delightfully gets out of work early because his wife and daughter are coming to visit him. Unfortunately for Roman he gets very sad news, his wife and daughter were killed in a devastating plane crash. Their plane colluded with another plane, both aircrafts crashed into the ground and there are no survivors.Next we cut to another stranger, Jacob 'Jake' Bonanos (Scoot McNairy), the air traffic controller who's labeled responsible for this major airplane collusion and he too is also devastated. Jake blames himself for the deaths of all 271 passengers who were on board those two flights and he slips into a deep depression. His depressed state is so deep, he doesn't know how to cook scrambled eggs and it also takes a toll on his wife, Christina (Maggie Grace) and son, Samuel. The fatal air traffic error not only destroys Jake's life, his house gets sprayed with words such as killer and murderer. Meanwhile, as Roman grieves over the deaths of his wife and daughter, he only has one motive now and that is revenge.Director Elliott Lester's (Blitz and Nightingale) film does have emotional tendencies but what's missing here is character development and a real story that knows how to deal with guilt and self-pity well. We all know that the former governor of California is trying to win the public back by making small, devastatingly grim dramas but 'Aftermath' is the kind of low-rent film you would normally find at your local pharmacy or grocery store for $9.99.Don't get down on your luck Arnold, you just need to 'GET TO THE CHOPPA!' and find scripts that will value your dramatic chops.","20","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"aftermath_2017","Schwarzenegger and McNairy give tremendous performances while the crew deliver inspired visuals, editing and sound design. It's a brutal and realistic film that doesn't sugar coat the harsh truth of its events and characters. Personally, I've this stage in Schwarzenegger's career, with him taking on more dramatic and subtle roles like this and 'Maggie'. I also recommend that after seeing them film, viewers should read up on the real life events and people that inspired the film.","50","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"aftermath_2017","Some great acting, especially from McNairy and surprisingly from Arnold as well. The story is gutwrenchingly tragic and considering it's a true story makes it all the worse.

En gennemlæsning af de amerikanske anmeldelser på Rotten Tomatoes viser, at ingen derovre kender til den oprindelige historie, som i filmen er omplantet til USA. Drabsmanden er dog stadig russer (immigrant) og spilles af Arnold, som altså her tager springet til karakterskuespiller. Det skulle han ikke have gjort. Filmen er gumpetung og og deprimerende, og Arnold formår slet ikke at formidle den dybe sorg, der ender med at gøre ham til drabsmand.

"alone_in_berlin","My opinion-.This movie of Vincent Perez was for my part very well realized and it knew how to draw the maximum of right emotions by strong images, making this beautiful thriller dramatic. Emma Thompson, Brendan Gleeson, Daniel Brühl, who gave their full performances to this movie based on this true story. It evokes German resistance to the Nazi regime and the conditions of survival of German citizens during the Second World War. It is based on the real story of Otto and Elise Hampel, executed on April 8, 1943, at the Plötzensee prison for acts of resistance and whose file at the Gestapo was transmitted to Hans Fallada after the war. Realistically, this movie, based on the novel by Hans Fallada published in 1947, which denounces the barbarity and cruelty of the Third Reich, the baseness of human nature subjected to fear and hatred and emphasizes the courage of A few who, in order to remain in harmony with their conscience and contribute to the destruction of that regime, were ready to give their lives. Moreover in this film, there are very beautiful scenes really moving especially, one advances in this movie and the final scenes are magnificent of power. A strong movie in every respect.","40","Drama"
"alone_in_berlin","The world has been asking the Germans why they supported the Nazis. The Germans honestly answered in the 1947 book by Hans Fallada Jeder stirbt für sich allein. (It was one of a few books in the tiny post-war library of my Polish parents. Primo Levi called it 'the greatest book ever written about German resistance to the Nazis'). But the world failed to listen and/or understand. While translated into Russian and Polish before 1950, the English version was produced in 2009, by the Americans, under inadequate title Every Man Dies Alone). So, in Alone in Berlin the Germans are explaining again, trying to make themselves understood by changing the victim from brother to son, and the language from German to English. In vain; the incredibly insensitive incompetence of the world film critics finds the story... boring. The monotony of daily avoidance of terror and death...boring. Banality of Truth. If you ever asked yourself what it would be like to live in Berlin 1939-1945, Alone in Berlin will tell you.","50","Drama"
"alone_in_berlin","Emma Thompson and Bendan Gleeson do a good job of playing Anna and Otto Quangel in this suspenseful drama. And Daniel Brühl (Inglorious Bastards) puts in a nuanced, compelling performance as the police detective. I liked ALONE IN BERLIN because it focuses on two ordinary German civilians who carry out such a simple subversive activity. We see so many stories of dramatic heroism - but this one is about people just doing what they can to protest. The story is told in a straightforward way with no sensationalism and very little action - and yet, it communicates the constant anxiety that people must have felt during the Nazi regime when you couldn't trust anyone - even your closest friends.","40","Drama"

"the_ticket_2017","I really loved this movie. beautifully shot. very slow but I liked that. so many movies are rushed nowadays. it wasn't just about the dialogue, the director aloud the actors to express so much emotion without speaking. lots of long shots. a nice slow pace for a simple story with a strong message. Dan stevens is phenomenal. such an incredible performance.","40","Drama"
"the_ticket_2017","I enjoyed this movie, but I will say I am quite biased as the message the movie was trying to bring across was one I agreed with.

"table_19","I normally wouldn't have picked Table 19 to watch, but I was glad I did. I enjoyed the movie. No, it wasn't overly complicated. It was funny, awkward, emotional and an enjoyable drama-rom-com movie. If you are fans of any of the cast, you'll likely enjoy it more because the ensemble worked well together.","40","Comedy"
"table_19","Well alot of people gave this film a mediocre review cause it does nothing brilliant, instead it does very simple things brilliantly.

"table_19","I mean the movie is nice and heartwarming I guess but I don't think they had an idea whether they wanted to portray the father of the baby as good or bad seeing that he behaves as a jerk at times, at all It just got me confused.

"table_19","Cute and funny, but light","30","Comedy"
"table_19","This may just be me, but I feel as though every film that Anna Kendrick attaches herself to instantly becomes watchable, due to the fact that her likability is always the most present thing in any film she's in. No matter how good or bad, her charming nature always has me finding something to like about the film. In this case, most critics have found Table 19 to be extremely hollow and have given it an overwhelmingly low score. I had been looking forward to this one for a while, but after reading a few reviews, I reserved myself and hoped for at least something enjoyable. Happily, this is one of the rare occasions where I have to disagree with the majority vote. Table 19 is a charming, harmless, one-location film with a lot of heart and here is why I believe it deserves some attention. Taking place almost entirely at a wedding, six random people have been placed at Table 19, which is the table that the leftovers/single people are placed at. All there for having some sort of relation to either the bride or groom, they are all strangers to each other. All having problems of their own, they form an unlikely bond and begin to find joy at a place that none of them really want to be at. With the addition of relationships falling apart or coming back together in surprising ways, Table 19 keeps its overall premise quite interesting from start to finish. Never once did I find myself bored, due to the very breezy 80-minute run time and the loveable cast of characters. I may be putting this film on a higher pedestal than it deserves, by stating that the sole reason this film is so good is due to the fact that the cast works terrifically together, but when a film desperately needs to do that in order for the story to work, not much else is needed here. This is such a simple one location premise, that it does just rely on its cast to carry it. Happily, everyone from the very talented Anna Kendrick, to the loveable June Squibb, to the pleasant sight of seeing Lisa Kudrow in the spotlight again, to seeing the very likely pairing of actors like Craig Robinson, Toni Revolori, and Stephen Merchant, there was a lot to love about these characters. Giving just enough backstory to each character during subtle lines of dialogue, I felt like I was getting to know all of them by the end of the film. There are only a few plot details set-up throughout the course of the first act, so it's very predictable when viewers finally reach the third act. This film is almost too simple for its own good, but that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed it so much. This a very short, very sweet, and very relaxed movie that tugs on just the right heart strings to leave you feeling very happy by the time the film ends. Some of the character decisions will bother a few people and the conclusion may not be exactly what everyone hopes for or frankly what may not suit the overall movie, but I quite enjoyed the conclusion and would honestly watch a television show with these characters at other events. That's truly how much I began to enjoy watching them on-screen. In the end, one-location films will always divide audiences for the most part. Some will be bored by the fact that it isn't exploring enough and other will find themselves loving the simplicity. I'm an avid filmgoer so I can accommodate my liking to either of the two. Table 19 has a fantastic cast of characters, therefore making for a very enjoyable viewing experience. It's most likely not going to be on my most-liked films of 2017, but it won't be one I'll soon forget, so that's more than a positive response coming from me. I really enjoyed my viewing of Table 19 and anyone who enjoys to relax and watch a simple movie that is very well-done, I have no problem giving this a recommendation. To my surprise, I think Table 19 is a great little movie.","40","Comedy"

"table_19","I was very excited to see this movie after seeing the first trailer, but I'm sad to say that it didn't live up to expectation. With such a great cast I expected the acting to be very good all-around, but that wasn't the case. Anna Kendrick's performance felt inconsistent many times, Tony Revolori's character was extremely one dimensional and insufferable, June Squibb was decent, but it felt like she may have phoned it in for this movie. Lisa Kudrow, Craig Robinson, and Stephen Merchant were the shining characters and even Andy Daly was great in his small appearances. The dialogue at times felt dull and sometimes heavy-handed. The writers seemed to just throw in anything that they felt would have an emotional impact on the audience in the second half of the movie, but it doesn't work because they showed the characters to be annoying egotists in the first half. Overall, while the movie has some shining moments, they don't make up for it's many glaring flaws.","20","Comedy"

Unfortunately it did not manage to keep its pace, feels too slow at times - not all of these are quiet meaningful moments that drive the emotions home.

Love the characters though and how bits and pieces were revealed as the movie progressed.","35","Comedy"

"table_19","The movie has (not so new) potential but fell short of thrust especially with the tandem of the cast at table 19. It could've been better to knit how different their lives were or tackle some other different things but maybe it's just the story's way of trying to veer away from The-Breakfast-Club plot to such extent Eloise and Teddy's story may act as a stand-alone.","25","Comedy"

"i_daniel_blake","I, Daniel Blake features a tour-de-force performance by Dave Johns, and it's one of the most powerful, exhilarating, and riveting films I've seen this year, and it's also one of the best films I've seen this summer.","50","Art House & International, Drama"
"i_daniel_blake","A touching yet scathing indictment of the bureaucratic social services system, one supposedly designed to aid its constituents but that's ultimately more concerned with rules, regulations and nitpicking than providing genuine care to the real people it's designed to serve. With excellent performances, a fine script and a directorial style aimed at showing more than telling, filmmaker Ken Loach's latest is well-deserving of all the accolades it has received. Despite a slight tendency to meander at times, this one is well worth your time, an inspiring tale about what we can do when our self-respect and personal dignity are on the line.","45","Art House & International, Drama"

"i_daniel_blake","A must-see for all the clueless lefties who think the 'state' is the solution to anything! This is what the state always evolves into. Those who actually help Daniel do so out of kindness and charity. To hold a gun to peoples' heads and steal a large portion of their hard-earned income by force is wrong, no matter how well intentioned. If something is a good idea, then most people will willingly help those in need; too bad they've already been robbed by the state and wasted so much on a bloated government bureaucracy that there is little left for those truly in need. Socialism has never worked and the comeback is always, 'Well it's just never been done right before. THIS TIME we know better.' Most people are basically good and caring. Let them willingly donate to those who they know will efficiently help those truly in need, in stead of robbing them by force. The state's best interest is to create a large dependency class to perpetuate their power, albeit temporary as it eventually fails. Central planning is a failed notion, and billions of people each making mutually beneficial decisions in their own interest is far more efficient. Not perfect - there is no such thing - but in the long run best. Cooperation over coercion, freedom over fascism.","40","Art House & International, Drama"
"i_daniel_blake","Solid film exposing the dark side of the British nanny state to those who are unaware of how much hoop-jumping goes on and just how futile one is made to feel.

"i_daniel_blake","Another fantastically real Loach movie that exposes the harsh but oft-ignored reality of so many people's lives and the culpability of a government that has lost any semblance of compassion for its less fortunate citizens - a damning indictment of a so-call modern day democracy told from the perspective of those who find themselves forgotten by their so-called leaders. I was actually so disturbed by what was happening to Daniel & Katie that I felt both angry and uncomfortable watching the almost inevitable end unfold.

"i_daniel_blake","The first 30 minutes frustrated me by feeling the need to throw the point down our throats and instead of allowing the natural stress of life shine through it felt the need to manipulate reality into its most moronic form, a little more subtlety would of gone a long way. The rest of the film however picked up from there and flowed in a much better fashion. The acting is without doubt the stand out winner for this film giving it a very human feel. It displays how those with nothing are often the most willing to give, and how the enphasis on systems and efficiency in modern society is often at the expense of the people they are supposedly there to help. Though the plot is not always elegant it's delivery is outstanding.","40","Art House & International, Drama"

"a_united_kingdom","Grade: A-Rating: PG-13, 111 minutesIn a Nutshell: Based on a true story, this lovely film illustrates how love and reason can change a crazy world. Bula! If you'd like to know more about the real people in this story, you can read Colour Bar: A United Kingdom by Susan Williams.Uplifting theme: Duty, honor, sacrifice, patience, tolerance, patriotismLove'We should not be fighting for segregation. We should be fighting for equality.' - Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo)'Africa can never be free until all those who live in her, white and black, recognize that race must have no bearing on equality and justice.' - Seretse Khama 'Opposition is one thing, Mr. Khama; the realities of government are quite another.' - Alistair Canning (Jack Davenport)'You have to be strong. You have a voice. Use it.' - Naledi (Terry Pheto)'No man is free who is not master of himself.' - Seretse'It is time!' - SeretseThings I liked:I had never even heard of Bechuanland. Have you? In 1966, it achieved independence and is now known as the Republic of Botswana. I'm always happy to learn new things in movies.I love seeing a proper marriage proposal when the man gets on one knee. Well done, Seretse. Nelson Mandela described the marriage between Seretse and Ruth as 'a shining beacon of light and inspiration.' Wouldn't that be amazing to have someone describe your marriage and legacy like that?David Oyelowo is absolutely fantastic in this. How about an Oscar for him? I also loved him in Selma. Great movie. Rosamund Pike is great in this also. She was crazy good in Gone Girl too, crazy being the key word in that sentence. Her subtle expressions say so much.Director Amma Asante has a bright future.The scene where the women sing a song to Ruth was so touching.I thought it was funny when Ruth's parents said, 'Mind yourself!' and 'Come back a missionary!' when she left the house. Things I didn't like:· There are some very ugly racial slurs and prejudiced behavior.· I've never understood parents who refuse to see their children again if they do something they don't like.· A lot of the Extras are terrible actors. Then again, they're natives who aren't actors.It's good to see Malfoy (Tom Felton) cast in another movie. Unfortunately, he plays an equally cruel, weaselly snake in this film too. Interesting lines:'He scares me a bit...the way he makes me feel.' - Ruth'I know I will never achieve anything there if I leave my heart here.' - Seretse'We'll take it moment by moment...together.' - Ruth'They're trying to define us, based on their rules, their idea of the world how they see it.' - Seretse'Let's not allow the ugliness of this world take away the joy from us.' - Seretse'Let him go. We need him more than you.' - Naledi'We've misjudged this, haven't we?'- Ruth'When a man tells a lie, he loses his dignity.' - SeretseFunny lines:'Did I ever tell you I didn't marry you just for your good looks?' - Seretse'Liar.' - Ruth (as she pulls up her skirt to reveal her beautiful legs.)Tips for parents: Some profanity.Some violence, bullying, and racism.Talk to your children about apartheid and segregation.There is some skin shown during a honeymoon moment.Some subtitles.Young children will be bored, but Tweens will be interested in the love story and historical telling.","45","Drama, Romance"

"a_united_kingdom","One of my biggest pet peeves is a film that says it is 'based on a true story', especially when they take a true story and completely embellish it to the point of falsehood just to make it entertaining (see: 'Hidden Figures'). Here is a case of at least the entire plot being verified history. Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams Khama joined together in marriage in one of the most prominent and controversial interracial unions in the history of the Western world. They knew they were going to have to face arduous opposition from governments and even their own families, but they did it anyway. Their story exposed the absurdity of the South African apartheid regime and the de facto racism of the United Kingdom at that time. The enlightened realization that race has no genetic basis was a long time coming, and the triumphs of the Khamas and the people of Botswana played an essential role in legitimizing this truth. Then there's that guy who played Draco in the 'Harry Potter' movies as a sniveling, petulant liaison to the British Ambassador of Botswana. Does that guy ever attempt a role that is out of his typecast? Obviously, the bureaucrats that exile Khama and try to keep Botswana down are jerks that deserve the bad press, but their mustache-twiddling malice constantly smacks you over the head. There's nothing subtle about who the bad racist white people are as they're characterized for maximum gumption-riling and satisfactory comeuppance. Maybe those people did have that much malice in real life, and maybe they need to tick off the audience like they do. By the consummatory ending, the film managed to gut-punch a few tears out of me, and I was willing to forgive being manipulated a bit. It's just too bad that southern Africa isn't very exciting to look at.","40","Drama, Romance"

"before_i_fall","Not about a second chance, but infinite!Even if you are not that into the films, you probably have seen at least a couple film related to 'time loop'. For me, this is like hundredth. When I first saw the trailer, I said 'not again'. 'Time loop' is just a concept, but the storyline for it drawn differently. It tells the story of a high school girl on the Cupid's Day, a special day for her since she has a big for it to remember. Like usual her day goes on and at the end of the day something goes wrong and then she wakes again on the same day in the following day which keeps repeating. Now how she's going to find a solution or the reason for it is covered in the rest of the film.Familiar them, but well designed storyline around it. In some way, it is same as 'Groundhog Day', though it is about a teenager and more serious and tragic tale. We sometimes wish for a second chance, that's how this film was developed, but even bigger scale with a small message for teenagers.Awesome performances, particularly Zoey. Predictable scenes, so I had thought of couple of ending that did not happen. And I also disappointed how it concluded. Not the best solution, yet an unexpected twist. Originally the film was based on the book of the same name. This is a small budget and a quality film. The direction was good, very rich in presentation.

"the_sense_of_an_ending_2017","The movie, adapted from a slim novel by Julian Barnes, is a tale of memory, guilt and regret. At the centre of the story is Tom, a divorced man in his late 60s, who leads a daily life of mind-numbing sameness. He receives a letter from a solicitor and Tom's routine is interrupted. From flashbacks to the 1960s, we learn he was involved with a lass called Veronica and met Adrian, a charismatic student. A thoughtless act leads to, or may not have led to, tragedy. How much of Tom's history (shown in the flashbacks) is true and how much is a distortion of his memory, is open to question.Meanwhile, Tom's life in the present continues. His daughter is close to giving birth which means regular meetings with his former wife. This gives Tom an opportunity to discuss the past. By staying alert and listening in to the conversations closely and watching the flashbacks carefully, clues emerge for us to discern the truth. Six fellow film fans and I saw the movie together and met for lunch afterwards. Our interpretations differed. An indication that we'd seen an exceptional film.There were things we agreed on: the ensemble cast was outstanding; the editing was first-rate; the music unobtrusive; and the director's touch admirable. Various actions of the major characters and possible actions not actually shown on screen were raised and analysed with the results agreed to by some, rejected by others. It's not a film for everyone ... but for those who enjoy a movie where clues are given but interpretations are left to the viewer, this one's for you.It's a movie that stays with you for days.","40","Drama"
"the_sense_of_an_ending_2017","The sense of a compromise: this looks something that started out with an idea of substance and was then taken over by lesser considerations. Its theme is how we see ourselves, and how blind or wrong we can be: an ageing, self-satisfied man finds out, maybe in time to change. Had the film made full use of its fine cast and drilled down into that problem, it might have delivered its message effectively. But it gets distracted - if you have the likes of Broadbent and Rampling, why waste them on long silences and vacant, unsatisfying dialogue? It resorts instead to unnecessary twists and incongruent bits of prurience. The latter is an annoyingly frequent feature of otherwise good quality British shows, and this one was not immune. The subject of sex is dealt with clumsily - the infantile lasciviousness of the girl's family, the unlikely and ambiguous car back seat scene, the tossing in of gratuitous references to the genitals including an awkward one about childbirth, which seems anatomically wrong in light of the preceding childbirth scenes. There are gaps and non-sequitors: was the girl's mother really such a foolish character, or was that how the boy saw her? Why didn't his smart university friends pull him up on his poor behaviour, and did he cause the tragedy, or not? Just as the slow-paced story seems, finally, to be approaching a reasonable denouement, it doubles back and relies for its ending by talking about events between characters whom we never see actually meeting in the film. This destroys what momentum it had. The worst of the prurience however is the explicit and detailed discussion of the method by which a youth took his own life, the information delivered by a likeable boy: this is utterly uncalled for, and inadvisable in circumstances where there is concern about rates of youth suicide and the publication of methods. Families might well attend this unawares, thinking that it will have an worthwhile discussion of some big life issues: the mature and stellar cast, and the title promised as much. Not as intelligent as it looks. And mind your young folk.","20","Drama"

"the_sense_of_an_ending_2017","This is fascinating if you are happy to watch the subtleties of human behavior. In a largely static narrative the attention is successfully maintained by flashbacks to a somewhat weird and repressed youth in the lives of Anthony and his undergraduate girlfriend Veronica. In the elderly phase of their lives they are portrayed by Broadbent and Rampling, as pretty annoying people, edgy, awkward and rather, well like they are anyway. Charlotte Rampling, watchful, uncommunicative, and inscrutable behind a chillingly cold stare, while Jim Broadbent plays his usually irascible self, alternating between grumpy old man and making somewhat gauche remarks and revealing to his ex wife things that were better left dead and buried in his youthful past. Their past is the centerpiece of the plot where the young Anthony is even more gauche and awkward in the relationship with his university girlfriend and this develops into a rather dark story of infidelity and tragedy which was destined to remain a secret until Anthony received a letter about a diary that had been left to him in a will.Despite some irritating personality traits in the main characters, the saving grace is the denouement of the story in which the rather unexpected twists supply a redeeming and thought provoking finale to this intriguing human drama and packs some moralistic and philosophical notions about the way we live our lives.","35","Drama"
"the_sense_of_an_ending_2017","The Sense of an Ending, based on the 2011 novel by Julian Barnes, is a story that centres on history and nostalgia, philosophy and love, flitting back and forth between a memory and the present as they bleed into one another. Much as this may seem on the surface level to be a great British love-story/ drama, it falls short, striking a rather dull tone, but nevertheless includes some excellent performances with a story that you can't help but invest in.Grumpy and retired Tony Webster (Jim Broadbent) receives a letter informing him that he has been left a diary in a will. Unsure to whom the diary belongs, he starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together to unravel the mystery that all began years ago in his youth.(Firstly, I have to admit that I haven't read the book so comparisons to the book in this review will be non-existent and focus solely on the film itself.)As a premise it seems fairly interesting; personally I quite enjoy stories of people looking back at their lives and seeing how what they did then can impact their present now, an examination into how a simple action could have drastic consequences further down the line. However, despite my personal predilection for these types of stories, the film is a slow starter; it takes some time for interesting events to occur and not all characters and their relationships are clearly defined, requiring a lot of unnecessary guesswork and delays any extra emotional investment in the story or characters until much later in the film. Nevertheless, despite the basics taking a while to secure (made harder by the interweaving storylines of past and present), once it gets going the twists and turns are good, making us enjoy any more guesswork and shocking us at each revelation.On the other hand the biggest revelation at the end, although an interesting and fairly unexpected twist in the story, isn't clearly explained, leaving many questions unanswered. Perhaps this was more easily understood in the book, however, although I applaud the effort to 'show-not-tell' the revelations in the story, the complexity of the story is a hindrance for the film. One can't help but come away from this film feeling robbed of the satisfactory, shocking ending it was leading up to.The parts of story set in the 1960s are particular highlights in my opinion. Beautifully shot, it shows an idealised version of the times, showing also the development of the character of old Tony Webster, initially saying he's not nostalgic, eventually admitting how he really is.As we often see in British dramas, this has an exemplary cast that is a joy to watch. From long established greats like Jim Broadbent and Charlotte Rampling, to recently established Emily Mortimer and Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, to up-and-comers Billy Howle and a surprising turn from Freya Mavor who I haven't seen since the 3rd generation of Skins (the one we don't talk about - what a relief she was the best in that lot!). Perfect casting for Jim Broadbent also, as he's perfect to carry this film. It could be very easy for his character to be unlikable, yet Broadbent seems to bring a lovable side to a bitter old man with the sort of charisma only he can bring. All an excellent cast that do well to carry the story, but particular mention goes to the central four, playing both old and young Tony and Veronica, the central lovers of this story (Jim Broadbent and Charlotte Rampling, Billy Howle and Freya Mavor respectively). To play young versions of acting titans is always an ask and they take this challenge on board marvelously. Freya Mavor and Charlotte Rampling in particular seem to be perfect parallels in their portrayal of young and old Veronica, whereas Billy Howle and Jim Broadbent seem quite different, though this isn't beyond the realms of possibility since so much can happen to change you in 50+ years, one of the central themes of the story itself.Whilst unlikely to stand out in British cinematic history, this is a pleasant adaptation of Barnes' book, an in-depth look at the consequences of love and jealousy, a study of nostalgia, with some wonderful showcases of British acting, although let down by the clumsy narrative that makes the story somewhat less engaging than it should be and occasionally hard to follow.","30","Drama"
"the_sense_of_an_ending_2017","I like the observation that ultimately, the story of our lives is one that we tell ourselves, and that we are active editors, choosing what to remember and what to forget.

"the_assignment_2017","'Dumb-Assignment is more like it'Movie Review: The AssignmentDate Viewed: April 13 2017Directed By Walter Hill (48 Hrs., Red Heat, The Warriors, Extreme Prejudice, Bullet to the Head, Streets of Fire, The Driver, Trespass and Undisputed)Written By Walter Hill and Denis HamillStarring: Michelle Rodriguez, Caitlin Gerard, Sigourney Weaver, Anthony LaPaglia, Tony Shalhoub, Yvette Nicole Brown, Terry Chen, Paul McGillion and Zak Santiago.Dumb-Assignment is more like it. This pile of shit is an awful movie for numerous reasons. It has nothing to say about transgender identity, the film premieres in theaters and VOD during a time where transgender people in the U.S. are being discriminated by right-wing politicians with their ludicrous laws and bathroom bills, it doesn't do any good for the careers of Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver and legendary action director Walter Hill and no wonder it wants to be a B-movie, the 'B' actually stands for bad.'The Assignment' is one of those movies that's so incoherent, ugly, vile and strange you just can't believe your eyes. Highly known for her bad-ass girl persona, Michelle Rodriguez seems to be everywhere these days, she will reprise her role as Letty in 'Fate of the Furious' tomorrow and right now she's a tough, street-smart female Smurf in 'Smurfs: The Lost Village'. She's always a good actress under better circumstances but here, her performance is such a blank note.Rodriguez chews it up big time as a male hitman named Frank Kitchen. I'm sorry? She's a man!?! Yes folks for the first 15 minutes or so of the movie, Rodriguez has a fake mustache and a fake dong. When we do first see Rodriguez as a male, I went 'You got to be kidding me', 'You're not serious', 'Okay, Am I being Punk'd right now?'. Okay, adults can believe that she does look like a man but they can also say that she can't play a man on screen because the thought of her as a man is just plain silly and flat-out creepy. There's also a sex scene between Rodriguez (in man form) and his or her female companion whose name is Johnnie (Caitlin Gerard) but it only lasts for like 10 seconds. WOW! This movie can't even make a sex scene between Rodriguez and another female seem fun. Actually, this movie seems to be allergic to both sex and cool action scenes because the action here is not that good.As Frank Kitchen enjoys his neo-noir life as a lethal killing machine man, a mysterious woman known as the Doctor (Weaver) hires a local San Francisco gangster who's honestly named Honest John (Anthony LaPaglia) to take her out without killing her. After she gets knocked down by Honest John, the Doctor performs a sex-change operation on Frank as an act of revenge for killing his brother. When Frank Kitchen wakes up, she's instantly back home but with a new horrific makeover, 'OH NO! I have boobies and a vagina now!'.The movie shifts back to the present where the Doctor is in a mental institution and she tells Frank Kitchen's story to her shrink, Dr. Ralph Galen (Tony Shalhoub). He doesn't believe her story for a second and he also doesn't believe that Frank Kitchen even exists. As for Kitchen, he maybe a she now but she still has the mind of a tough hitman. Kitchen seeks refuge in Johnnie's apartment where she plans her ultimate act of revenge which is killing the person who's responsible for transforming him into a woman.Co-written by Walter Hill and Denis Hamill (who previously did 'Turk 182'), 'The Assignment' was apparently written in the late 70's and boy does it show. Action movies of any kind can be fun, bloody and stylish, look at the 'John Wick' films for example, these movies had style, characters we cared about, great fight sequences and shootouts and in your face one-liners. However in this movie, the action is poorly done and the style here is all dark and murky. In fact, this whole movie seems all dark and murky to me. How so? It's almost as if somebody put motor oil on the lens. The question on everybody's mind is, what happened to Walter Hill? The 74-year-old filmmaker was on the top of his form with low-budget action classics such as 'The Driver', 'The Warriors', 'Extreme Prejudice' and of course '48 Hrs.', since then he has gone the deep end with big-time bombs such as 'Wild Bill', 'Last Man Standing', 'Supernova' and 'Bullet to the Head'. He used to be the grand wizard of this genre but not anymore.With awful performances and cruddy action, 'The Assignment' hits a bullseye at being a complete waste of time and for everyone involved. It is an inept piece of work from Walter Hill and it's one of the worst movies of 2017.","05","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense"
"the_assignment_2017","Reprehensible garbage! The Assignment is a film that feels 30 years too late and even 30 years ago people would've raved about how terrible this film is.

"the_assignment_2017","Good trashy fun. I enjoyed this film. It's also one of the weirdest things I've seen in a while. At times I was scratching my head wondering 'what the hell is this?. But I for sure wasn't bored. And I'm a bit surprised by the intense negativity surrounding it over the whole transgender thing. The story really isn't about anything transgender at all. The forced sex change story is just a gimmick, to put a spin on the typical hitman scenario. But yeah, I guess I do understand that some will feel this is in bad taste. It's definitely not for everybody. There's plenty to criticize here - Michelle's dude makeup is often unconvincing. There are plot holes galore, and some things really don't make any sense at all. But there's plenty of good stuff too - It looks great and moves fast. The music score is excellent and has a cool retro feel. The action is well done. If you're expecting big budget stuff like explosions, car chases, or epic fight scenes, you'll be disappointed, The action is mostly just Michelle shooting bad guys. But these scenes are quick and efficient and done with style. There are really good performances from Tony Shalhoub and Sigourney Weaver, too. I'm not big a fan of Michelle Rodriguez in general. I thought she was OK here. Michelle affects a retro, tough guy style of speech, like in an old gangster film, and I think this is alienating some people. The performances overall are pretty campy, but Michelle sometimes feels like she's in a different film. The film also has some comic book aspects to it. Every now and then a scene will freeze frame and change to a comic book drawing before moving on to the next scene. This looks cool, but it happens randomly. They should have done this either a lot more or not at all. This is actually one of my bigger criticisms - the film often doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Some parts are campy and outrageous, others parts are very straight forward. The whole movie probably needs to be even weirder and more shocking than it already is. Even with its flaws, I recommend it for the more adventurous film fan.","40","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense"

"the_assignment_2017","Overall: Negative (Skip It)While Shalhoub and Weaver attempt to redeem the damage done by Rodriguez and her character, it just isn't enough. For this movie, while featuring them, is about the revenge of Frank Kitchen. Someone who seems so generic, so contrived, you are almost surprised this isn't starring Steven Segal. Though what makes this movie so bad is that it takes itself seriously. As if Rodriguez is really doing something with her performance and is on the level of Shaloub or Weaver. That is, rather than embarrassing herself and leading you to question how all these actors, who have been part of huge action franchises, would ever sign up for this movie. Hence why I'm saying to skip it. Rodriguez has become a proven co-star, and female token, but being that she hasn't really challenged her acting ability, perhaps in years or more than a decade, it shows. It shows to the point that you almost wonder what may happen to her career when she is no longer able to hang with the guys and be that tough chick anymore?","20","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense"

Due to Iko Uwais it will no doubt be unwantedly compared to The Raid and although it is not in the same league, it is definitely a decent action flick.","30","Drama, Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"

"headshot_2017","I'm giving the 90 second trailer 5 stars. The Raid movies are in a compete league of their own when it comes to action and choreography so I'm stupidly excited for this! Would love a confirmed release date for the UK.","40","Drama, Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
"headshot_2017","In the same vein as THE RAID movies, this epic display of martial arts, ultra violence and incredible choreography will keep you entertained from start to finish. Simply stunning.","45","Drama, Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
"headshot_2017","Movie was a bit of a drag compared to THE RAID ' 2 hours too long should've been cut to an hour & a half. A Very ultra-violent film. The end fight scene Was well choreographed.","30","Drama, Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
"headshot_2017","S'il n'as rien d'original, empruntant en autre à la série Jason Bourne, et ne réinvente pas le genre , Headshot est tout de même un très bon film d'action que les fans du genre vont apprécier même s'il s'avère moin intense que The Raid et sa suite","35","Drama, Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"

"voice_from_the_stone","The film itself is fairly authentic enough to see. I was surrounded by characters' emotions during the movie, but this movie was lacking of story. i dare to presume that film wasn't fully interesting to audience when it comes to the content.","35","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","boring, awful nonsense. felt like a 4 hour film somehow and it lead absolutely no where. pretends to be a horror but it was a romance/drama? I don't even know what the fuck I just watched. khaleesi, I want my money back.","10","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"

"voice_from_the_stone","Esteetiliselt ilus, kergelt kõhedust tekitav ja ilma üleliigsete lisadeta. Tegevust on nii vähe, et unustad ennast filmi esteetikasse ja hakkab huvitav.","45","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","Voice from the Stone [Eric Howell, 2017, United States] a slow nonsensical thriller that goes nowhere. 2/10","10","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"

"voice_from_the_stone","'Voice from the Stone' is a slow paced and so-called thriller , however Clarke saves it from total humiliation '","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers and this one did not disappoint. The combination of a gripping story, acting prowess, eerie setting, and exceptional cinematography using mostly natural light drove the story in a remarkable way that played with my emotions and left chills in my bones.","50","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","Misleading. Not scary or thrilling. If it wasn't for Emilia Clarke the movie wouldn't be a movie. Her character was the only one with any dynamic, but it simply went no where. I'm not even sure what happened at the end. No good.","10","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"

"voice_from_the_stone","Just one word.Incredible.","50","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","An enigmatic and not-entirely-satisfying genre attempt, VOICE FROM THE STONE has some admirable qualities. Right from the jump, it's easy to detect the sort of tropes its playing with and well-known tales its borrowing from; there's clearly a lot of THE INNOCENTS in here, along with handfuls of JANE EYRE, REBECCA, THE OTHERS, and a number of other things (including the works of Poe). The movie looks terrific (though slightly on the BBC or PBS side), courtesy of some truly striking location shooting and strong art direction; the movie has an interesting (and not frequently used) setting - both time and place - and the locations sell this aspect incredibly well. The film doesn't tip its hand early, and while I appreciate that (from the standpoint that it keeps the proceedings mysterious), the flipside of that is that the first half of the movie (and then some) is almost entirely lacking in incident, sticking instead mostly to character study type stuff with the eerie trappings hinting at the dangerous or the otherworldly. Emilia Clarke's protagonist is both one of the movie's more intriguing elements and also the source of a rather disconnected quality it has; the character is obviously kind and thoughtful, but there's something off about her (stemming from the page, not the performance). The character is alternately shown to be eminently profession and also ill-at-ease (bordering on awkward). Sweet and also curiously reserved. Clarke conveys all of this well, and there is definitely a payoff to it involving the character's repression, but it is difficult to really buy into the arc here. At the end of the day, the movie gets a nice simmer going, but never manages to get things boiling. There's interesting stuff here, but it doesn't fully come together.","25","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","Stick to Game of Thrones. This movie was terrible!","05","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","I really liked this movie and Emilia Clarke and the other guy is great. The little kid is creepy but that's understandable. The rabbit scene was about as gross as this film gets which was FANTASTIC. My husband dragged me to this and I ended up loving it more than he did! Almost a perfect movie.","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","Incredibly boring. You think it's going to get better but second half of movie gets worse.","20","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
"voice_from_the_stone","Wow. Just wow. So good!","50","Mystery & Suspense, Drama"
